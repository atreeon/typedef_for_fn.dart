Not compatible with built_value_generator

built_value_generator 
    v6.3.1 uses analyzer 

Need analyzer_plugin to upgrade to 35.3 of analyzer
    then built_value_generator to update to latest version of analyzer_plugin




What version of analyzer_plugin does built_value use - <35.0

Can I drop down a level of my typedef_for_fn

It is build that uses 35.3 or whatever...I need to drop down a level of build
